# family-birthday-api

I admit, I'm bad with birthdays because they aren't that important to me! The inspiration for this app comes from my sister-in-law. She is the opposite of me, so it's important to remember when her birthday is. I decided to make an app that works as a CRM of sorts for my and my significant other's immediate family members to keep track of birthdays. 

This is a work in process, and I will update as I continue to build!
