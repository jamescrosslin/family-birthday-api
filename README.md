# family-birthday-api

I admit, I'm bad with birthdays because they aren't that important to me! The inspiration for this app comes from my sister-in-law. She is the opposite of me, so it's important to remember when her birthday is. I decided to make an app that works as a CRM of sorts for my and my significant other's immediate family members to keep track of birthdays. 

## built with
- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- CSS
- Auth0 for authentication

## work in progress updates

App is mostly functional! Updates needed:
- styling
- customize auth paths
- add landing page
- heroku issue with add birthday page
